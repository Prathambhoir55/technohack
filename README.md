# Our Vision:
A disabled person, although differently abled, still faces a lot of difficulties in his/her day-to-day functioning. We aim to create a platform which enables every differently abled person to lead a normal and peaceful life.

# Features of the prototype for the differently abled:  
1) AI Voice assistant
2) Support group portal
3) Live lecture portal 
4) Video tutorials from external sources 
5) Resale e-market place for assistive devices
6) Live ASL learning platform


# Future prospects: 
We plan to enhance the features of our prototype by -
1) Inviting NGOs to contribute to our mission and aligning with our website
2) Collaborating with more video creators and hence expanding our tutorial library
3) Introducing renting of assistive devices on our e-marketplace.
